# Webpack Boilerplate

This repo contains boilerplate for a new npm/webpack project, which I should be able to use as an entry point for new projects in the future.

It comes with babel, eslint, prettier, and jest installed. Note that I'm still getting to grips with these different packages and how they interact with each other, so there are probably lots of things set up suboptimally, and some things may be broken. This boilerplate is very much a work in progress.
